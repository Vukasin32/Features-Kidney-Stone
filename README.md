Feature engineering on real life examples of kindey stone pictures.
The project is done in collaboration with University Clinical Center Of Serbia - Urology Clinic 
in may of 2024. 
The pictures are provided by Clinic and big thanks to them. 
To save anonimity of patients, there names are deleted from database.

There were found 11 statistically significant features that can be used in AI models for distinguishing between 
patients with and without kidney stones.
